# 🧮 Algorithms Study Plan

## Day 1: Preparation & Fundamentals

**Goal:** Understand the expectations for top-tier tech interviews (specifically Google) and review core computer science concepts.

### 📚 Required Reading
Start by reading **Steve Yegge's Guide:**
[Get that Job at Google](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)

### 🔑 Key Study Topics
*Based on highlights from the article:*

#### 1. Core Data Structures & Algorithms
* **Algorithm Complexity:** You need to know **Big-O**. It is a must.
* **Sorting:** Know how to sort.
  * *Avoid:* Bubble-sort.
  * *Master:* At least one `O(n log n)` algorithm (preferably two, e.g., **Quicksort** and **Merge Sort**).
* **Hashtables:** Arguably the single most important data structure. You absolutely must know how they work.

#### 2. Trees & Graphs
* **Trees:**
  * Know the basics (construction, node manipulation).
  * Be familiar with at least one **balanced binary tree** (Red/Black, Splay, or AVL) and its implementation.
  * **Tree Traversal:** Understand BFS vs. DFS, and the difference between Inorder, Postorder, and Preorder.
* **Graphs:**
  * *Importance:* Graphs are fundamental. If you have a problem, there is a 50-50 shot it involves a graph.
  * **Representation:** Understand the pros/cons of Objects & Pointers, Matrix, and Adjacency List.
  * **Traversal:** Know BFS and DFS, their computational complexity, tradeoffs, and implementation.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Whenever someone gives you a problem, **think graphs**. Make absolutely sure you can't think of a way to solve it using graphs before moving on to other solution types.

#### 3. Advanced Theory & Systems
* **NP-Complete Problems:**
  * Understand what "NP-complete" means.
  * Study famous classes like **Traveling Salesman** and the **Knapsack Problem** so you can recognize them in disguise.
* **Operating Systems:**
  * **Concurrency:** Processes, threads, context switching, locks, mutexes, semaphores, and monitors.
  * **Pitfalls:** Know about deadlock, livelock, and how to avoid them.
  * **Resources:** Understand memory management and what resources processes/threads require.
